introtext: We offer an evolving suite of educational services and tools

We are actively developing seminars, talks and video-based content to help your staff skill up on the state of DevOps. The CloudyOpsPoet YouTube channel will be a major outlet for this, but Meetups and Conferences are where it's been at until now.

We also have a partner service, DevUps, which is a community-run mentoring space for DevOps and allied professionals.
