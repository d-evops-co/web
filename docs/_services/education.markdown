introtext: We offer an evolving suite of educational services and tools
---

We are actively developing seminars, talks and video-based content to help you and your staff skill up on the state of DevOps. The CloudyOpsPoet YouTube channel will be a major outlet for this, but there'll also be in-person meetups and conferences, and engagements are available on requst at your office.

We also have a partner service, [DevUps](https://devups.org/), which is a community-run mentoring space for DevOps and allied professionals, and can help with 1:1 mentoring and coaching.
