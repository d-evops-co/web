Our Principal Engineer has built, managed and maintained significant workloads and applications across all three major cloud vendors, as well as some more niche providers. We lean toward Infrastructure-as-Code with Terraform, but also retain skills in ARM, CloudFormation and the respective API and CLI offerings.
