introtext: We work across all major clouds, and we're not entirely averse to on-premise either.

Our Principal Engineer has built, managed and maintained significant workloads and applications across all three major cloud vendors, as well as some more niche providers. We lean toward Infrastructure-as-Code with Terraform, but also retain skills in ARM, CloudFormation and the respective API and CLI offerings.

We're also dab hands at Cost Control.
