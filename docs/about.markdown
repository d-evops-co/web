This is The DevOps Company

We like to keep things simple, so here's the simple "about us" info.

The DevOps Company is run by Jason Brown, a DevOps veteran with a CV as long as your arm. We're small, but flexible. We do DevOps and Web and we want to make the web better with every job we do.

You can send us email on jasbro (at) jasbro.io

You can get Jason on Mastodon via his Official Account, [CloudyOpsPoet](https://mastodon.social/@cloudyopspoet)

You'll be able to send us physical mail just as soon as we have our PO box set up.

This website is based on [jekyll-theme-console](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console), in deference to the amount of time a DevOps professional spends gazing into the darkness of a command prompt.
