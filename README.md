The website for The DevOps Company

## Who?

Small, independent DevOps and Cloud consultancy, operating physically out of Melbourne, Australia, but virtually from Everywhere.

## What?

A fairly basic little static website based on Jekyll. The interactivity, which is being slowly built in happens across various clouds.

## Why?

Because people need help with their Software Delivery Pipelines and workflows, and sometimes they need advice, or an extra pair of hands, or just a grizzly old web veteran to give them some stories about disasters and horror shows. Or just have their grammar checked by a proper human.
